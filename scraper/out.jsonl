{"title":"This traditional grating tool is vanishing from Filipino kitchens","content":"GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – An old Visayan riddle goes, “Kabayo ni Adan, dili mokaon kon dili kabay-an (Adan’s horse, won’t eat unless you ride it).”The riddle refers to a traditional Filipino household tool called by many names – kaguran or kudkuran in Mindanao and the Visayas, kayuran among Tagalogs, pangudkuran in Batanes, and igad or pagigadan among Ilocanos.In English, the names simply translate to coconut grater or scraper, a wooden bench with a sharp, serrated rounded steel tip on one end. Benjamin Almeda Sr., known as the “Father of Filipino inventors,” introduced the contraption to his fellow Filipinos in the early 1950s. Almeda is credited for the invention of various food processing machines that are commonly used to this day. To use the kaguran, one has to mount the bench to manually grate coconut on its rounded blade. It is  used to grate the meat of mature coconut or niyog.A well known process among Filipinos and other Southeast Asians, it is done for easy extraction of coconut milk that is locally called gata, which is produced by squeezing the grated coconut with one’s hands. Gata is mixed in many Filipino dishes and delicacies.“You cannot have gata without the kaguran unless you masticate the coconut,” jested retired government employee Bobby Catubig who is fond of cooking the famous binignit, a popular Holy Week staple that consists of sticky rice, jackfruit, tubers, and tapioca pearls cooked in coconut milk.When there are festivities and important celebrations, the kaguran takes prominence in its role in delectable creamy food preparations.During Holy Week, when most Filipinos cook popular native delicacies with coconut milk, kaguran or igad takes center stage. Households without the traditional tool and relies on borrowing kaguran from their neighbors, usually become the butt of jokes in the neighborhood.A favorite anecdotal alibi of those that did not prepare food during Holy Week or Halloween, “the neighbor failed to return their kaguran” or “the neighbor did not lend their kaguran.”With the advent of technology, the manually-operated household grater is slowly fading from the kitchen of many Filipinos. The kaguran has also become scarce in most stores. Some online shops sell it, but, relatively expensive at more than a thousand pesos, beyond the means of an ordinary individual.Instead of buying kaguran, many residents have resorted to having their coconuts grated by enterprising vendors who also provide motor-driven coconut grating and grain grinding services.In Palawan, some shops that offer the motorized grating service retain the shell and coconut pulp to be sold as feed, retired development worker and craftsperson Aveen Acuña-Gulo told Rappler on Saturday, March 30.Gulo said she buys coconuts from these shops but opts to “take home the coconut pulp for my compost, the coconut water to be made into vinegar and the shell as firewood.” The most practical option is to buy ready-to-use coconut cream and milk sold in packs, though this is more expensive than buying a coconut and having it grated.The cost of a coconut, to include grating, is P30 while a 200ml pack of pour coconut milk costs P35. The P30-grated coconut yields double that of the 200ml pack.Thirteen-year-old Gio Rebollido recalled that the kaguran provided bonding time with his father whenever the family prepared food for a celebration. “We are happy and when we’re happy, the food becomes delicious,” he said.Gio would ride the kaguran in tandem with his father while grating coconut. The laughter and noise created by the horsing around on the kaguran would add to the joyful atmosphere during celebrations, he said.    “When you are happy preparing food, that happiness flows into the food, making it delicious and satisfying,” Catubig said. But, such a practice is about to vanish and will soon just be a thing of the past amont younger generations, he said. – Rappler.com","images":["http://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/426836757_1131481787978871_8310487694675038378_n.jpg"],"category":"\n\t\t\tFilipino culture\t\t","articleUrl":"http://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/kaguran-traditional-grating-tool-philippines","datePublished":"2024-03-30T02:08:55.000Z"}
{"title":"Pope skips Good Friday procession ‘to preserve his health’","content":"VATICAN CITY – Pope Francis cancelled at the last minute his attendance at the Good Friday procession at Rome’s Colosseum, in what the Vatican described as a bid “to preserve his health” ahead of more Easter week engagements.Francis’ agenda for the next two days consists of an Easter Vigil service on Saturday evening, March 30, and an Easter Mass and the twice-annual “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and world) message and blessing on Sunday morning, March 31.The 87-year-old’s sudden no show is likely to renew concerns about his declining strength. Francis uses a cane or a wheelchair to move around due to a knee ailment, and suffers from repeated bouts of bronchitis and influenza.Good Friday leads on Sunday to Easter, the most important and joyous date in the Church’s liturgical calendar – commemorating the day Christians believe Jesus rose from the dead.The Vatican announced the pope’s absence from the “Via Crucis” (Way of the Cross) procession just as it was about to start, saying in a statement he would follow it remotely from his Vatican residence.Francis, who had looked fitter this week after weeks in which he struggled to speak in public and cancelled some meetings, also missed the procession last year, after recovering from a four-day hospital stay for bronchitis. (READ: Pope, looking well, visits female prison for foot-washing ritual)The Via Crucis at the Colosseum is a re-enactment of Jesus’ death by crucifixion, in which participants take turns in holding the cross as they walk in and around the ancient Roman arena, stopping to pray and hear meditations.Nuns, priests, a hermit, charity workers, migrants and disabled people were among those who took part in the service, held in a landmark monument believed to have been a place of martyrdom for early Christians.Francis personally wrote the meditations for this year, a first in his 11-year papacy. They included praises for meekness and forgiveness in response to acts of evil, and prayers for persecuted Christians and war victims.The pope, who has called for the Church to become less male-dominated, also hailed the women who helped Jesus while he carried the cross, and pleaded for “those (women) who in our own day are exploited and endure injustice and indignity”.In another sign of his focus on women, Francis on Thursday, March 28, performed the foot-washing ritual, which recalls Jesus’ gesture of humility to his apostles at the Last Supper, in a women’s prison in Rome.Earlier on Friday, March 29, the pope joined cardinals and bishops for the Passion of the Lord service in St. Peter’s Basilica, which featured chants in Latin recounting events from Jesus’ arrest to his burial.In previous years, Francis would start the service prostrating himself on the floor of the basilica, but his frail state no longer allows him to do so. Instead, he arrived in a wheelchair and prayed silently in front of the main altar. – Rappler.com","images":["http://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/pope-francis-vatican-holy-week-2024.jpg"],"category":"\n\t\t\tPope Francis\t\t","articleUrl":"http://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/pope-francis-skips-good-friday-procession-preserve-health","datePublished":"2024-03-30T01:21:58.000Z"}

Filipino drag queen Marina Summers finishes as a runner-up during the finale episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race: UK vs The World season 2, representing the Philippines as part of the top four.The results were announced on Friday, March 29 (Saturday, March 30 in Manila), after the top four battled in a “lip sync smackdown for the crown.”Following her runner-up finish, Marina thanked her fans in a X post.Maraming salamat, world 🌎 We fought hard on this one ✊🏽🇵🇭Marina walked down the “Finale Eleganza Extravaganza” runway in a black, blue, and gold ensemble, donned with coral and pearl elements. She explained that the dress was inspired by the Philippines’ rich marine biodiversity– the culmination of her second Drag Race journey. During final critiques, the Filipina drag queen was praised for her performance during the season. Michelle Visage even said Marina is a “drag queen’s drag queen.” “Drag touches people’s lives. I can attest to that because drag saved my life. Growing up in a very small town, I never thought that drag existed. This is the kind of person I wanted to be when I was young, but I did not know it was possible,” Marina said when RuPaul asked why the world needs drag now more than ever.Marina picked Australia’s Hannah Conda to lip sync to Anastacia’s “I’m Outta Love” for the first round of the lip sync smackdown, with the Australian drag queen winning the battle.United Kingdom’s Tia Kofi was crowned the season’s “Queen of the Mothertucking World.” She won £50,000, which was the first time a cash prize was awarded in a Drag Race UK series. France’s La Grande Dame was also among the finalists. Spain’s Arantxa Castilla-La Mancha was named the season’s Miss Congeniality. Marina’s journey during the international competition was nothing short of gag-worthy, filled with jaw-dropping looks and fierce performances. Her latest look was a breathtaking traditional Yakan wedding ceremony attire, stunning the judges. Marina’s homage to Philippine cultural diversity and strong performance secured her the top 4 spot. In the season’s first episode, Marina captivated the judges with her rendition of “AMAFILIPINA,” a reimagined version of Maymay Entrata’s “AMAKABOGERA,” during the talent show. She later faced off with La Grande Dame in a lip sync battle, with Livin’ Joy’s “Dreamer” as the chosen track, and won her first gold RuPeter badge.She earned her second RuPeter badge in the Rusical episode, with RuPaul praising the drag queen as being “born to do drag” during critiques. During the Rusical episode of “RuPaul’s Drag Race: UK vs. the World” in early March, Marina Summers became the fourth queen to be told by RuPaul that she was born to do drag. #DragRaceUK #TeamMarinaRELATED: https://t.co/UjK3gURgfY pic.twitter.com/1pTVbFNgNpShe received her third RuPeter badge with a makeshift karaoke designer piece by Neric Beltran during the “Business in the Front, Party in the Back” runway. Marina is the only contestant to earn three badges during the season. She was also hailed for donning a beautiful volcano outer dress made by fashion designer Job Dacon, and for her glowed up “Terno She Better Don’t” look, inspired by the national fish of the Philippines, the bangus or milkfish.Marina, who finished first runner-up in Drag Race Philippines season one, is the first drag queen from the Philippines to join an international franchise. – Rappler.com","images":["http://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-29-at-10.10.58-PM.png"],"category":"\n\t\t\tdrag queens\t\t","articleUrl":"http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/series/marina-summers-runner-up-rupaul-drag-race-uk-world","datePublished":"2024-03-30T00:54:28.000Z"}
{"title":"In prison, mother and baby share P85 a day for food, medicine","content":"First of 2 partsEditor’s Note: This story is based on an original submission by Ateneo de Manila students Angeline Braganza, Allison Co, and Iana Padilla for their investigative journalism class.In October 2020, activist Reina Mae Nasino, surrounded by cops, wrapped up in full protective gear, and wearing handcuffs, attended her baby’s funeral.Nasino and her baby River became icons of injustice, not just of the crackdown on dissent during the Duterte administration, but of the conditions of detained mothers who simply want to care for their newborn babies. Baby River was separated from Nasino at birth, and died when she was only three months old.“I would randomly wake up, tears welling in my eyes. And then, I would find myself embracing the last shirt my baby wore,” Nasino said in a recent interview. In 2023, she was acquitted of charges pertaining to illegal possession of firearms and explosives.Nasino, who spent most of her pregnancy in the Manila City Jail, is just one of the countless mothers in the Philippines who enter prison with a baby in their wombs. Over in Mandaluyong, there is a 21-square-meter room in the Correctional Institution for Women (CIW) called the mothers’ ward.Here stay persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) who are pregnant, or had just given birth. The mothers’ ward consists of six beds, a shared bathroom with curtains serving as a door, a meager pantry, faded stickers of cartoon characters on the walls, and a shelf of dusty toys.Maria*, 34, was once among the expectant mothers – she entered CIW eight months pregnant in September 2023. The following month, she gave birth to a baby boy. While she felt delighted to welcome this little drop of joy into her life, she couldn’t cope with the storm of financial demands that assaulted her. Maria had to borrow money from a fellow PDL to cover her ultrasound sessions, check-ups, and laboratory fees.The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) has a measly P15-medicine budget per PDL, per day. According to lone resident doctor and Corrections Technical Chief Superintendent Maria Lourdes Razon, this already accounts for everything medical – from medicines to medical supplies like cotton balls and alcohol, and even period products. There’s no separate budget for a PDL who is pregnant or ill. In CIW, according to Razon, PDLs who have prescription medicines have to deposit in the pharmacy whatever money is provided by their families. The pharmacy then deducts from the fund whatever medicines PDLs avail of. When needed, and especially for births, CIW’s pregnant PDLs are referred to the Mandaluyong City Medical Center (MCMC), a stone’s throw from the prison. Razon claimed that the PDLs who need procedures need not shell out any money, as it is a public hospital. But such does not seem to be the case – if Maria’s experience is any indication.Maria was lucky that her fellow PDL had an extra P3,000 she could spare from the money deposited in the pharmacy.A shortage of resources and medical staff compromises the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, particularly in terms of prenatal and postnatal care. This situation forces pregnant PDLs to bear the financial burden of medical expenses, as Maria herself experienced. As of March 2024, the CIW has a population of around 3,100, but, according to Dr. Razon, the facility is meant to house only 1,000.Besides Razon, there are only 13 nurses to tend to the over 3,000 PDLs in CIW, translating to one nurse for every 231 women, with no obstetricians, gynecologists (OB-GYN), nor midwives.The CIW shares a line item with the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in the BuCor’s budget. From the P5.2 billion budget the NBP and CIW shared in 2023, their budget was cut down to P4.72 billion in 2024. But NBP likely takes a significant share. The notoriously overcrowded men’s prison housed around 30,000 by end-November 2023 – 10 times as many as the population in CIW.If one were to assume that CIW takes 10% of the budget, that leaves just P472 million for the CIW in 2024. This already accounts for administrative and operational costs.The National Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), which oversees local city and municipal jails that exclude the BuCor-supervised CIW, recorded more than 1,600 pregnant detainees and 485 births in the past two years. On the rare times that specialists who are part of medical missions organized by non-government organizations are able to visit, pregnant PDLs get to be examined. But more often than not, they have to make do with the little that’s available.The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said that only 37 out of 84 women’s dormitories are equipped with a breastfeeding room, again indicating very limited access to maternal health services.According to Dr. Jonelle Baloloy, chief resident of the MCMC OB-GYN ward, PDLs who come to the hospital for maternal services are treated no differently from other patients, but when they need services that don’t require admission, they are prioritized in the queue since they only have limited time outside prison.After securing permits to leave the facility, PDLs from CIW are accompanied by an escort and a nurse. There have been reported issues, however, according to Baloloy, of PDLs “having difficulties in securing permits to leave the facility.” For example, for OB patients, she said, “their follow-up appointments are fixed, so those are easy. But since the hospital or local government unit pays for laboratory fees, the PDLs still have to go through the LGU for those appointments.”Both CIW and MCMC assert that PDLs don’t have to shell out any money for their procedures, and if ever they do, fees are minimal, or the hospital finds a way to get the local social welfare office to pay for them. Yet women PDLs still say that what they need help the most with is still financial support. It doesn’t help that the P15-medical budget covers the mothers only. Babies, who have their own needs like diapers, clothes, and hygiene products, are not PDLs and are excluded from the budget. While there is a separate P70-food allocation per day, or just P23.33 for a meal, pregnant PDLs and breastfeeding mothers need more because they also require special nutrition, like increased fluid intake.“Most of the time, our food doesn’t have soup. We need more food, because we have increased appetites. Every time our children breastfeed, we go hungry,” said Maria.The infirmary may not always be prepared to handle swift births as well.“As much as possible, we really refer [births] to the nearest government hospital, MCMC. We are not equipped to deliver babies. Although there was one who went into labor quickly, and we weren’t able to bring her to the hospital on time. We were able to guide her through her labor. But we worry sometimes [about sudden births] since I’m not here 24/7, or if there’s a problem with the baby. We’re not equipped, because we are just an infirmary,” said Razon.For Imelda Duras of the CHR Prevention Cluster Visitorial Division, prison medical staff should be equipped with multidisciplinary, and not just custodial, skills. Some of these skills include being able to provide psychological and social support for PDLs. “So there should be health [personnel] – nurses and doctors – and we should have mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers,” said Duras. Karen Bantang from the CHR Gender Division also cited the alarming concern about postpartum depression among mother PDLs. A study conducted by the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development found that 15.6% of Filipino women experience depression during pregnancy and 19.8% after childbirth. The pregnant PDLs of CIW aren’t any different.With resources already at the bare minimum for women in the mothers’ ward, they also deal with the mental anguish of possibly not being able to live out the duties of motherhood.

{"title":"Building fairness into AI is crucial – and hard to get right","content":"Artificial intelligence’s capacity to process and analyze vast amounts of data has revolutionized decision-making processes, making operations in health care, finance, criminal justice and other sectors of society more efficient and, in many instances, more effective.With this transformative power, however, comes a significant responsibility: the need to ensure that these technologies are developed and deployed in a manner that is equitable and just. In short, AI needs to be fair.The pursuit of fairness in AI is not merely an ethical imperative but a requirement in order to foster trust, inclusivity and the responsible advancement of technology. However, ensuring that AI is fair is a major challenge. And on top of that, my research as a computer scientist who studies AI shows that attempts to ensure fairness in AI can have unintended consequences.Fairness in AI has emerged as a critical area of focus for researchers, developers and policymakers. It transcends technical achievement, touching on ethical, social and legal dimensions of the technology.Ethically, fairness is a cornerstone of building trust and acceptance of AI systems. People need to trust that AI decisions that affect their lives – for example, hiring algorithms – are made equitably. Socially, AI systems that embody fairness can help address and mitigate historical biases – for example, those against women and minorities – fostering inclusivity. Legally, embedding fairness in AI systems helps bring those systems into alignment with anti-discrimination laws and regulations around the world.Unfairness can stem from two primary sources: the input data and the algorithms. Research has shown that input data can perpetuate bias in various sectors of society. For example, in hiring, algorithms processing data that reflects societal prejudices or lacks diversity can perpetuate “like me” biases. These biases favor candidates who are similar to the decision-makers or those already in an organization. When biased data is then used to train a machine learning algorithm to aid a decision-maker, the algorithm can propagate and even amplify these biases.Fairness is inherently subjective, influenced by cultural, social and personal perspectives. In the context of AI, researchers, developers and policymakers often translate fairness to the idea that algorithms should not perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases or inequalities.However, measuring fairness and building it into AI systems is fraught with subjective decisions and technical difficulties. Researchers and policymakers have proposed various definitions of fairness, such as demographic parity, equality of opportunity and individual fairness.Why the concept of algorithmic fairness is so challenging.These definitions involve different mathematical formulations and underlying philosophies. They also often conflict, highlighting the difficulty of satisfying all fairness criteria simultaneously in practice.In addition, fairness cannot be distilled into a single metric or guideline. It encompasses a spectrum of considerations including, but not limited to, equality of opportunity, treatment and impact.The multifaceted nature of fairness means that AI systems must be scrutinized at every level of their development cycle, from the initial design and data collection phases to their final deployment and ongoing evaluation. This scrutiny reveals another layer of complexity. AI systems are seldom deployed in isolation. They are used as part of often complex and important decision-making processes, such as making recommendations about hiring or allocating funds and resources, and are subject to many constraints, including security and privacy.Research my colleagues and I conducted shows that constraints such as computational resources, hardware types and privacy can significantly influence the fairness of AI systems. For instance, the need for computational efficiency can lead to simplifications that inadvertently overlook or misrepresent marginalized groups.In our study on network pruning – a method to make complex machine learning models smaller and faster – we found that this process can unfairly affect certain groups. This happens because the pruning might not consider how different groups are represented in the data and by the model, leading to biased outcomes.Similarly, privacy-preserving techniques, while crucial, can obscure the data necessary to identify and mitigate biases or disproportionally affect the outcomes for minorities. For example, when statistical agencies add noise to data to protect privacy, this can lead to unfair resource allocation because the added noise affects some groups more than others. This disproportionality can also skew decision-making processes that rely on this data, such as resource allocation for public services.These constraints do not operate in isolation but intersect in ways that compound their impact on fairness. For instance, when privacy measures exacerbate biases in data, it can further amplify existing inequalities. This makes it important to have a comprehensive understanding and approach to both privacy and fairness for AI development.Making AI fair is not straightforward, and there are no one-size-fits-all solutions. It requires a process of continuous learning, adaptation and collaboration. Given that bias is pervasive in society, I believe that people working in the AI field should recognize that it’s not possible to achieve perfect fairness and instead strive for continuous improvement.This challenge requires a commitment to rigorous research, thoughtful policymaking and ethical practice. To make it work, researchers, developers and users of AI will need to ensure that considerations of fairness are woven into all aspects of the AI pipeline, from its conception through data collection and algorithm design to deployment and beyond. – Rappler.comThis article originally appeared on The Conversation.Ferdinando Fioretto, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, University of Virginia","images":["http://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/artificial-intelligence-3-2024-scaled.jpg"],"category":"\n\t\t\tartificial intelligence\t\t","articleUrl":"http://www.rappler.com/technology/features/building-fairness-into-ai-crucial-hard-to-get-right","datePublished":"2024-03-30T01:00:00.000Z"}
